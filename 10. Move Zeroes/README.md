# 283. Move Zeroes

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Arrays, Two Pointers  

---

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note:** You must do this **in-place** without making a copy of the array.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:** `nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`  
**Output:** `[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`

---

### Example 2:
**Input:** `nums = [0]`  
**Output:** `[0]`

---

## Constraints:

- \(1 \leq nums.length \leq 10^4\)
- \(-2^{31} \leq nums[i] \leq 2^{31} - 1\)

---

## Follow-Up:

Could you minimize the total number of operations done?
